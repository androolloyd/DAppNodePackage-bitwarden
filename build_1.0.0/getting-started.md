# Let's get you started running your own password manager.

Your are now in control of all your password but we can make it more comfortable.

## Access to bitwarden from anywhere.

Currently you can access to your bitwarden by connecting to your dappnode wifi or access it using your dappnode vpn and then access to http://bitwarden.dappnode

But it could be boring so you can do the following thing to access it from anywhere:

### Step 1:
Enabling port forwarding to the port you choose in the package configuration (default is 8343).

### Step 2:
Set a new domain name entry to your domaine name provider such as bitwarden.dappnode.io for example.

### Step 3:
Adding https for encryption.

For this you can follow this tutorial: https://github.com/nathPay/ansible-letsencrypt

It install nginx and generate the configuration and the letsencrypt certificate for https.

Or you can do it your way :)
